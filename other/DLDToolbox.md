summary: The purpose of this toolbox is to address questions related to the diagnosis of Developmental Language Disorder (DLD). The intention is to summarize diagnostic issues for the international community of speech-language pathologists / speech and language therapists (or others) concerned with identifying DLD. Infographics and other tools will be developed to support decision making whenever possible. There will be a particular focus on identifying DLD in school children and an educational context, although other age groups and contexts will be addressed as well.
