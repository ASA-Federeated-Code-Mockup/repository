## Welcome to the Speech and Language Resource Bank!

Here you can find links to a wide range of resources for research and teaching on speech and language. Our ultimate aim with this site is to provide a comprehensive index of the available resources in the field, complete with essential metadata and crosslinks between related work. 

If you would like to contribute, particularly if you would like your own resource indexed on our site, please contact us via one of the email addresses listed below, join our Slack channel ([slrbank.slack.com](https://slrbank.slack.com)), or find us on Github ([github.com/slrbnet](https://github.com/slrbnet)).

The resources in the SLRB are broadly organized into four categories:

#### [Analysis](https://www.slrb.net/category/analysis.html)
Anything related to the analysis of speech/language data, including software, packages/libraries for programming languages, and individual scripts will be indexed here.

#### [Data](https://www.slrb.net/category/data.html)
All data resources, including audio, video, and text corpora, as well as experimental data such as participant responses in  behavioral perception tasks, will be indexed here.

#### [Education](https://www.slrb.net/category/education.html)
Any educational material that would be useful for teaching speech/language science at any level will be indexed here. This includes images/diagrams, videos, and material (software or hardware) for classroom demonstrations.

#### [Experimentation](https://www.slrb.net/category/experimentation.html)
Resources that may be used in designing or implementing experiments on speech and language, from software to run the experiment to code to generate experimental stimuli, will be indexed here.
