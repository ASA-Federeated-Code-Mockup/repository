### Welcome to the Speech and Language Resource Bank!

[This site is currently under construction, so check back soon for updates.]

Here you can find a wide range of resources for research and teaching on speech and language. Our ultimate aim with this site is to provide a comprehensive index of the available resources in the field, complete with essential metadata and crosslinks between related work. 

If you would like to contribute, particularly if you would like your own resource indexed on our site, please contact one of us at the email address listed below, join our Slack channel ([slrbank.slack.com](https://slrbank.slack.com)), or find us on Github ([github.com/slrbnet](https://github.com/slrbnet)).

The resources in the SLRB are broadly organized into four categories:

### [Analysis](https://www.slrb.net/category/analysis.html)

### [Data](https://www.slrb.net/category/data.html)

### [Education](https://www.slrb.net/category/education.html)

### [Experimentation](https://www.slrb.net/category/experimentation.html)
