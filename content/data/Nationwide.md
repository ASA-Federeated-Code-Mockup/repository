summary:The Nationwide Speech Project (NSP) corpus is a corpus of spoken language containing recordings of young male and female talkers from six regions of the United States. Speech samples include isolated words, sentences, passages, and interview speech. The purpose of the Nationwide Speech Project was to develop a corpus of spoken language that can be used in acoustic and perceptual studies of regional dialect variation in the United States (Clopper & Pisoni, 2006).
