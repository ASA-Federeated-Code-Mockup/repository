summary: The World Atlas of Language Structures (WALS) is a large database of structural (phonological, grammatical, lexical) properties of languages gathered from descriptive materials (such as reference grammars) by a team of 55 authors. WALS contains different features, which is a structural property of language that describes one aspect of cross-linguistic diversity. A WALS feature has between 2 and 28 different values, shown by different colours on the maps. Most features correspond straightforwardly to chapters, but some chapters are about multiple features.
