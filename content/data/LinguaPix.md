shortdesc: LinguaPix is a database of picture naming norms. 1,620 colour photographs of items spanning across 42 semantic categories were named and rated by a group of German speakers (and are currently evaluated by a group of Dutch, English, Polish, and Cantonese speakers).  
summary: 1,620 colour photographs of items spanning across 42 semantic categories were named and rated by a group of German speakers. This was done to establish the following linguistic norms: speech onset times (SOT), name agreement, accuracy, familiarity, visual complexity, valence, and arousal. The data, including over 64,000 audio files, were used to create the LinguaPix database of pictures, audio recordings, and linguistic norms, which to our knowledge, is the largest available research tool of its kind.
