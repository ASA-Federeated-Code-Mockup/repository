shortdesc: A collection of data from the Language05 project that tracks children's language development and processing ability from 6 months to 4-6 years.  
summary:The Language05 project was a multi-methodological longitudinal cohort study that tracked the language development of 90 English-learning children from 6 months to 4;6 years (2014 to 2019). Its goal was to establish how differences in processing abilities interact with linguistic knowledge, socio-cognitive skills and the environment to predict individual differences in language acquisition. The project was supported by the International Centre for Language and Communicative Development (LuCiD: www.lucid.ac.uk) and funded by the UK Economic and Social Research Council [ES/L008955/1].
