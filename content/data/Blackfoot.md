summary: Blackfoot Words is a database of lexical forms in Blackfoot (Algonquian). By “lexical forms” we mean inflected words, stems, and morphemes. These have been collected and digitized from many different written sources. We created the database and this website to provide access to a large amount of lexical data for the Blackfoot communities and for language researchers.
