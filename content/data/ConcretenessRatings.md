shortdesc: We have collected concreteness ratings for 40 thousand English lemma words with Amazon Mechanical Turk. The ratings come from a larger list of 63 thousand words and represent all English words known to 85% of the raters. As such, the list can be used as a reference list for future word recognition in (American) English.  
summary: Concreteness ratings are presented for 37,058 English words and 2,896 two-word expressions (such as “zebra crossing” and “zoom in”), obtained from over four thousand participants by means of a norming study using internet crowdsourcing for data collection. Although the instructions stressed that the assessment of word concreteness would be based on experiences involving all senses and motor responses, a comparison with the existing concreteness norms indicates that participants, as before, largely focused on visual and haptic experiences. The reported dataset is a subset of a comprehensive list of English lemmas and contains all lemmas known by at least 85% of the raters. It can be used in future research as a reference list of generally known English lemmas.
