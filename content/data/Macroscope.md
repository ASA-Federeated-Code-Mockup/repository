summary: Macroscope is a powerful tool built to provide comprehensive analyses of historical meaning of words with click of a button. This enables quick insights for a curious explorer, requiring no little to no knowledge of computational linguistics. At the same time, the function to download the raw data of any figure caters to researchers who don’t want to design their own solutions from scratch.
