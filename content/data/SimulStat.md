summary: StimulStat is a lexical database for Russian language which allows selecting words and word forms based on different parameters and finding values of various parameters for a list of words or word forms. The resource was created primarily for experimental studies of Russian. In such studies, it is often necessary to select stimuli for which some target property varies (e.g. accent), while many other properties (e.g. length, frequency, part of speech) either coincide or are carefully balanced. However, the database can also be used for many other purposes: for example, for selecting words with certain characteristics in teaching Russian, in all sorts of tests and assignments, and also for scientific papers.
