shortdesc: Normative data of 374 Dutch idiomatic expressions by 390 native speakers.  
summary: Normative data of 374 Dutch idiomatic expressions by 390 native speakers. In an online test, we asked participants to judge various dimensions of idiomatic expressions on a five-point scale: Frequency, Usage, Familiarity, Imageability, and Transparency. In addition, we objectively assessed their knowledge of idiom meaning by means of a multiple choice question. The dataset contains the aggregated results per expression for the 5 subjective dimensions and the objective Idiom knowledge recognition.
