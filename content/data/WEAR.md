shortdesc: We have collected affective norms of valence, arousal, and dominance for 13,915 English words (lemmas). They are a complement of our age-of-acquisition ratings and subtitle word frequencies. \
summary: Information about the affective meaning of words is used by researchers working on emotions and moods, word recognition and memory, and text-based sentiment analysis. Three components of emotions are traditionally distinguished: valence (the pleasantness of the stimulus), arousal (the intensity of emotion provoked by the stimulus), and dominance (the degree of control exerted by the stimulus). Thus far, nearly all research has been based on the ANEW norms collected by Bradley and Lang (1999) for 1,034 words. We extend the database to nearly 14 thousand English lemmas, providing researchers with a much richer source of information, including information on gender, age and educational differences in emotion norms. As an example of the new possibilities, we included the stimuli from nearly all category norms (types of diseases, occupations, and taboo words) collected by Van Overschelde, Rawson,and Dunlosky (2004), making it possible to include affect in studies on semantic memory.
