shortdesc: childLex is based on a corpus of children’s books and comprises 10 million words that were syntactically annotated and lemmatized. childLex reports linguistic norms for lexical, superlexical, and sublexical variables in three different age groups: 6–8 (grades1–2), 9–10 (grades 3–4), and 11–12 years (grades 5–6).     
summary: childLex is an age-based lexical database extracted from a corpus of books intended for 6- to 12-year-old children. childLex provides separate norms for children 6 to 8 (beginning readers, grades 1–2), 9 to 10 (intermediate readers, grades 3–4), and 11 to 12 (experienced readers, grades 5–6) years of age. The childLex corpus was compiled from books that are intended to be read by children in their leisure time. It mainly comprises narrative, informal texts (such as the books of the Harry Potter series), but also includes some formal and ex-pository texts (science books, etc.).
