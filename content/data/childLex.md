summary: ChildLex is a cooperation project with the University of Potsdam and the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences. The corpus comprises over 10 million words contained in a selection of 500 children's books and reading books. The books cover the age range of 6-12 years and can be queried either in total or separately in three different age groups (6-8, 9-10, 11-12 years). Most of the linguistically and psychologically relevant variables are made available for around 200,000 different words. ChildLex is freely accessible and can be used by interested researchers as well as teachers, speech therapists or speech therapists to create better, child-friendly examination and training materials for German.
