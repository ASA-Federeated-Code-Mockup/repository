shortdesc: Real-time magnetic resonance imaging and electromagnetic articulography database for speech production research.  
summary: USC-TIMIT is a database of speech production data under ongoing development, which currently includes real-time magnetic resonance imaging data from five male and five female speakers of American English, and electromagnetic articulography data from four of these speakers. The two modalities were recorded in two independent sessions while the subjects produced the same 460 sentence corpus. In both cases acoustics were recorded in parallel with the articulatory data. The database, and companion software tools, are freely available to the research community.
