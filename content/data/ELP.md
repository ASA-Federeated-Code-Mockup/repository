shortdesc: The English Lexicon Project affords access to a large set of lexical characteristics, along with behavioral data from visual lexical decision and naming studies of 40,481 words and 40,481 nonwords.  
summary: The goal of the English Lexicon Project (ELP) is to collect normative data for speeded naming and lexical decision for over 40,000 words across 1200 subjects at 6 different universities. These data will be integrated into a database along with descriptive characteristics of the words used in the study. Researchers interested in psycholinguistics, human memory, computational modeling, and other fields will find these data useful. For example, researchers will be better equipped to select stimuli, test theories, and reduce potential confounds in their studies.
