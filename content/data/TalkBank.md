summary: TalkBank is the world's largest open access integrated repository for spoken language data. It provides language corpora and other audio resources to support researchers in Psychology, Linguistics, Education, Computer Science, and Speech Pathology. There are 14 main components of TalkBank: AphasiaBank, CHILDES, FluencyBank, HomeBank, PhonBank, ASDBank, BilingBank, CABank, ClassBank, DementiaBank, RHDBank, SamtaleBank, SLABank, and TBIBank. These components are being used to study the cognitive, neurological, developmental, and social bases of language processing and structure.
