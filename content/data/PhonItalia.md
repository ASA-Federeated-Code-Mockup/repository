shortdesc: PhonItalia is an open access lexical database that provides phonological representations for 120,000 Italian word-forms.  
summary: PhonItalia is an open access lexical database that provides phonological representations for 120,000 Italian word-forms. Each of the entries is provided with a comprehensive range of information including syllable boundary and stress markings, uniqueness points, neighbourhood estimates, and other measures, including written word-frequency and part of speech markers provided by the Colfis orthographic corpus (Laudanna, Thorton, Brown, Burani, & Marconi, 1995; Bertinetto et al., 2005). Using data derived from this core lexicon an additional range of databases have also been compiled to provide frequency of use statistics for Italian phonemes, syllables, syllable onsets and codas, plus character and phoneme bigrams.
