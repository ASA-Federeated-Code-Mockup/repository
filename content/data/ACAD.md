shortdesc: The Arizona Child Acoustic Database is a longitudinal collection of audio samples from children between the ages of 2-7 years.  
summary: The goal of the Arizona Child Acoustic Database project was to obtain a large set of acoustic recordings, primarily vowels, collected from a cohort of children over a critical period of growth and development. Data was recorded longitudinally from 63 children between the ages of 2;0 and 7;0 at 3-month intervals. The protocol included individual American English vowels and diphthongs, nonsense multi-vowel transitions, word level multi-vowel sequences (e.g., Hawaii), single-syllable words targeting each American English vowel, short sentences, and conversation. Acoustic files are available for download through the University of Arizona Library Repository for use in future research projects. Longitudinal recordings may be of interest because they allow tracking of acoustic characteristics produced by an individual child during a period of rapid growth and speech development.
