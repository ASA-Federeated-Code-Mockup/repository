shortdesc: Corpus for contemporary (1954-present) written Dutch. The corpus contains over 500 million words of full texts from a wide variety of text types including both texts from conventional media and texts from the new media.  
summary: The SoNaR project aims to build a large corpus (minimum 500 million words) of contemporary written Dutch that can serve as a general reference for all kinds of research into language and language use. This includes descriptive research (as reflected in eg dictionaries and grammars), but also research in the field of language and speech technology. For such research it is very important that large amounts of data are available with the possibility to process this data with your own software.
