shortdesc: The Auditory English Lexicon Project (AELP) is a multi-talker, multi-region psycholinguistic database of 10,170 spoken words and 10,170 spoken nonwords.  
summary: The AELP is a multi-talker, multi-region psycholinguistic database of 10,170 spoken words and an identical number of nonwords. Six tokens of each stimulus were recorded as 44.1 kHz, 16-bit, mono WAV files by native speakers of American, British, and Singapore English, with one from each gender. Identification norms, as determined by the average intelligibility scores and confidence ratings from between 15 and 20 responses per token, were obtained from 561 participants. Auditory lexical decision accuracies and latencies, with between 25 and 36 responses per token, were obtained from 438 participants. The database also includes a variety of lexico-semantic variables and structural indices for the words and nonwords, as well as participants’ individual difference measures such as age, gender, language background and proficiency. Taken together, there are a total of 122,040 sound files and over 4 million data points in the AELP.
