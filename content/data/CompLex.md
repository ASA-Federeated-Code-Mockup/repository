shortdesc: A database of eye tracking reading English Compounds  
summary:The CompLex database presents a large-scale collection of eye-movement studies on English compound word processing. A combined total of 440 participants completed eye tracking experiments in which they silently read unspaced English compound words (e.g., goalpost) embedded in sentence contexts (e.g., Dylan hit the goalpost when he was aiming for the net.). Three studies were conducted using participants representing the non-college bound population (300 participants), and four studies included participants recruited from the student population (140 participants). The database comprises trial-level eye-movement data (47,763 trials), participant data (including a measure of reading experience estimated via the Author Recognition Test), and lexical characteristics for the 931 English compound words used in the studies.
