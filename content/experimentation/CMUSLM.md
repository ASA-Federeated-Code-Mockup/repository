shortdesc: The CMU-Cambridge Statistical Language Modeling toolkit is a suite of UNIX software tools to facilitate the construction and testing of statistical language models. The SLM toolkit is meant for large amounts of training data.  
summary: The Carnegie Mellon Statistical Language Modeling (CMU SLM) Toolkit is a set of unix software tools designed to facilitate language modeling work in the research community. Version two is no longer limited to the use of bigram and trigram models, and provides support for n-grams of arbitrary size. It also provides support for several discounting schemes, rather than limiting the user to the Good-Turing discounting strategy used in version one. In addition, the tools used to count word n-grams, vocabulary n-grams and id n-grams have been re-written to increase greatly their speed of operation. Other changes include a more flexible way of handling context cues, the ability to calculate probabilities from ARPA format language models, the ability to force the model to back-off under certain circumstance (for example, if there is an unknown word in the context), and support for gnuzip compressed files as well as files compressed with the compress utility.
