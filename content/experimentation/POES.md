shortdesc: The Program for Open-Ended Scoring (POES) is a computer program used to score open-ended tests. It was originally designed to score the Levels of Emotional Aareness Scale (LEAS), but it can also be used to score other text material.  
summary: The Levels of Emotional Awareness Scale (LEAS) is an open-ended measure of the ability to describe emotional reactions. Scoring the LEAS by hand is complex and time consuming. Therefore, Program for Open-Ended Scoring (POES) was designed to score the LEAS quickly and easily. Because POES scoring is fast and efficient, it allows more researchers and clinicians to use the LEAS, thus moving away from self-report measures of emotional awareness.
