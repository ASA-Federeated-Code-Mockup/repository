shortdesc: jsPsych is a JavaScript framework for creating behavioral experiments that run in a web browser.  
summary: jsPsych is a JavaScript library for the development of Web-based experiments. jsPsych formalizes a way of describing experiments that is much simpler than writing the entire experiment from scratch. jsPsych then executes these descriptions automatically, handling the flow from one task to another. The jsPsych library is open-source and designed to be expanded by the research community.
