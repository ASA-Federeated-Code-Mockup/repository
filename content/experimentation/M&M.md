shortdesc: Mix will allow experimental stimuli to be pseudo-randomised, according to constraints supplied by the user in a simple script. Match can match the conditions of factorial experiments. Both utilities have the ability to significantly speed up the development, and even improve the quality and power of your experiments.
summary: Mix and Match are tools to support experimental research. Mix is a Windows program that can generate pseudorandomized orders according to complex, user-specified constraints. Mix can be used to generate a novel item order for each individual participant, even for complex experiments in which stimulus and/or response repetition is an experimental variable of interest, or for which automated randomization would not normally be possible. The program also contains a number of other practical features for generating files for use with a variety of experiment control software. Use is limited to academic or other nonprofit applications. Matching large groups of items or participants on multiple dimensions is a difficult and time-consuming task, yet failure to match conditions will lead to suboptimal experiments. Match automates this process by selecting the best-matching items from larger sets of candidate items. In most cases, the program produces near-optimal solutions in a matter of minutes and selects matches that are typically superior to those obtained using hand matching or other semiautomated processes.
