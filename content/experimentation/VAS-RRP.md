shortdesc: The Visual Analogue Scale for Rating, Ranking, and Paired-Comparison (VAS-RRP) can be used to collect rating, ranking, and paired-comparison data simultaneously. For researchers: You may use the VAS-RRP generator to help you design your own VAS-RRP scale and administer a survey.  
summary: VAS-RRPs consist of two components: The first is a testlet, composed of one or more items, which may be of one or several semantic types—such as adjectives, nouns, phrases, and sentences—for eliciting participants’ internal responses, including attitudes, opinions, interests, and so forth. The second component is a continuous rating scale, which is a line continuum with a midpoint and two directional arrows referring to two increasingly opposite levels of semantics. The generator is an authoring tool that researchers and practitioners can use to easily construct their own VAS-RRPs, administer a survey and collect data for further analysis.
