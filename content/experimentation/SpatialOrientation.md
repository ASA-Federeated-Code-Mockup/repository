shortdesc: On each trial of the SOT, people are shown an array of objects; they have to imagine being located at one object, facing a second object (the orienting cue). They must indicate the direction of a third object (the target object) by drawing a line from the center of the circle in the direction believed to be correct.  
summary: On each trial of the SOT, people are shown an array of objects; they have to imagine being located at one object, facing a second object (the orienting cue). They must indicate the direction of a third object (the target object) by drawing a line from the center of the circle in the direction believed to be correct. The computer program, written in Java, allows users to enter participant numbers (up to 999), ages, gender, test time (up to one hour), and whether participants each receive the 12 items in the same order or in a different random order.
