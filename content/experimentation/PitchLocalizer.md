shortdesc: The Efficient Pitch Localizer stimuli are designed to effectively localize pitch regions and to work well with Sensimetrics Earphones. There are two types of stimuli: harmonic tones and frequency-matched gaussian noise.  
summary: The study focuses on a set of “pitch-sensitive” regions in human auditory cortex that respond approximately twice as strongly to sounds with a pitch compared with a non-pitch control such as gaussian noise. Although many studies have investigated neural responses to pitch, the large majority of neuroimaging studies have used stimuli with so-called “unresolved harmonics”, which produce a weak pitch percept. Here, we show that pitch-sensitive regions throughout auditory cortex respond mainly to resolved harmonics, the dominant cue for human pitch perception. We also show that when tested with resolved harmonics, pitch-sensitive regions exhibit a distinctive anatomical profile relative to tonotopic landmarks.
