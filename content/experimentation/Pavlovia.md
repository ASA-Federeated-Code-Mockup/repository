summary: Though it was originally conceived as a repository and launch platform for PsychoPy experiments, its open architecture makes it possible to support other open-source tools, such as jsPsych and lab.js. Browse the ever-growing repository of public experiments. Share your experiments with specific users and groups, or make them public. We are currently hosting nearly 70,000 experiments built by over 20,000 designers.
