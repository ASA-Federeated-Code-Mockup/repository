shortdesc: BITTSy is capable of running key infant behavioral testing paradigms, including Headturn Preference Procedure [HPP], Preferential Looking, and Visual Fixation/Habituation, through the same interface.  
summary: BITTSy was created to fill a need for a multi-paradigm experimental testing platform for infants that can be implemented consistently across multiple testing sites. BITTSy is capable of running key infant behavioral testing paradigms, including Headturn Preference Procedure [HPP], Preferential Looking, and Visual Fixation/Habituation, through the same interface. BITTSy is the first standardized system to support headturn preference procedures, and the first with the capability to combine this paradigm with other methods in a single testing session. It is a freely available, standardized system that is compatible with modern Windows operating systems.
