shortdesc: LeTalker is the name of a Matlab GUI version of the three-mass model of vocal fold vibration originally described in: Story and Titze (1995). LeTalker includes both subglottal and supraglottal (vocal tract) systems.  
summary: LeTalker is a Matlab version of the three mass vocal fold model originially published by Story and Titze (1995) but updated and enhanced by Titze and Story (2002). The model is one of a collection of lumped-element models of the vocal folds. Users are free to use the code as a starting point for model development or as a comparison to previously written code (just give credit where due).
