shortdesc: AUX (AUditory syntaX) is a scripting syntax specifically designed to describe and process auditory signals. In a nutshell, it consists of 1) functions to create and process sound signals, 2) operators particularly relevant to sounds, and 3) usual mathematic operations that you may find in any programming language.  
summary: AUX (AUditory syntaX) is a scripting syntax specifically designed to describe auditory signals and processing, to the members of the behavioral research community. AUX Viewer is a program that generates, visualizes, and plays sounds specified in AUX. AUX Viewer can also be used for class demonstrations or presentations. Another program, Psycon, allows a wide range of sound signals to be used as stimuli in common psychophysical testing paradigms, such as the adaptive procedure, the method of constant stimuli, and the method of adjustment. AUX Library is also provided, so that researchers can develop their own programs utilizing AUX. In short, the use of AUX can be potentially beneficial to all members of the research community—both those with programming backgrounds and those without.
