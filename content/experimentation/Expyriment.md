shortdesc: Expyriment is an open-source Python library for designing and conducting timing-critical behavioural and neuroimaging experiments.  
summary: Our major goal is to provide a lightweight and well-structured Python library for the script-based experiment development. Readability and portability of the resulting programme code are of highest priority. The library is an all-in-one solution as it handles stimulus presentation, the recording of input/output events, communication with other devices, and the collection and preprocessing of data. It further offers a hierarchical design structure, which allows for an intuitive transition from the experimental design to a running programme and is therefore also well suited for students and researchers with little programming experience.
