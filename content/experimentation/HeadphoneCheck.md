shortdesc: This code implements a headphone screening task intended to facilitate web-based experiments employing auditory stimuli.  
summary: As a screening task, it is intended to precede the main task(s), and should be placed at or near the beginning of an online experiment. Participants who pass are allowed through to the remainder of the experiment, but those who do not pass should instead be routed to an ending page and must leave the experiment after screening. The task is a 3-AFC "Which tone is quietest?" task with 200Hz pure tones. Unbeknownst to the participant, a random one of the tones is in antiphase across the stereo channels, resulting in heavy attenuation only when heard over loudspeakers (but not over headphones). This results in very poor performance if the task is attempted without headphones.
