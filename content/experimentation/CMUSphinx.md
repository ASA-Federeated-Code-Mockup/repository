shortdesc: CMU Sphinx is a set of speech recognition development libraries and tools that can be linked in to speech-enable applications.  
summary: The Sphinx-4 speech recognition system is the latest addition to Carnegie Mellon University's repository of Sphinx speech recognition systems. It has been jointly designed by Carnegie Mellon University, Sun Microsystems Laboratories and Mit- subishi Electric Research Laboratories. It is differently designed from the earlier Sphinx systems in terms of modularity, flexibility and algorithmic aspects. It uses newer search strategies, is universal in its acceptance of various kinds of grammars and language models, types of acoustic models and feature streams. Algorithmic innovations included in the system design enable it to incorporate multiple information sources in an elegant manner. The system is entirely developed on the JavaTM platform and is highly portable, flexible, and easier to use with multithreading.
