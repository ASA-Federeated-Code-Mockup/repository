shortdesc: A fully automated tool that estimates speech onset on the basis of multiple acoustic features extracted via multitaper spectral analysis.  
summary: Here we present Chronset, a fully automated technique aimed at further enhancing the robustness and accuracy of automatic speech onset detection. Chronset detects voice onset with a high degree of precision relative to human ratings, such that most of its errors occur in a small (<50 ms) window surrounding a manually annotated RT (reaction time).
