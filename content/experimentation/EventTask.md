shortdesc: The Event Task Stimulus Set was created to measure access to generalized events stored in semantic memory. It has been examined in a large normative sample as well as in people with neurological disorders (Dresang, Dickey, & Warren, 2020), and to measure semantic violations in visual processing (Proverbio & Riva, 2009).  
summary: The Event Task is a picture-based assessment of semantic memory which was developed and published by the Language and Brain Lab. Events can be defined as collections of people, objects, actions, places, and the context in which they occur. Semantic memory is a long-term memory involving the ability to recall words and concepts. Semantic memory is crucial in our ability to produce and understand sentences, which is often impaired for people with aphasia. This task measures how functional or impaired their ability to access these semantic memory representations is in the context of events.
