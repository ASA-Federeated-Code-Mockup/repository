shortdesc: Conducting online auditory experiments? A new headphone test to help you to efficiently screen out participants who probably aren't using headphones.  
summary: Rapid (~3 minutes) test for headphone use. In this short task, listeners will be presented with three white noise sounds with silent gaps in-between. One of the noises has a faint tone hidden within. Participants will be asked to decide which of the three noises contains the tone, and click on the correct corresponding button (1, 2, or 3). The task has been shown to be very efficient to detect people that are not wearing headphones.
