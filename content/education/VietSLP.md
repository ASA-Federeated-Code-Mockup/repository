summary: The San Diego State University Bilingual Development in Context research lab has created and validated a set of assessment tools for the Vietnamese language. Though these tools have not yet been standardized, they have been used in research studies with Vietnamese-speaking children, monolingual or bilingual, within the age range of 3 to 10 years. These tools are meant to be administered by Vietnamese-speaking speech-language pathologists or related professionals. They can also be used by speech-language pathologists who are working with a Vietnamese interpreter or paraprofessional.
