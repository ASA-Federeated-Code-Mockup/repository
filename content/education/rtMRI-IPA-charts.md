shortdesc: Real-time MRI data from phoneticians producing the sounds of the International Phonetic Alphabet, together with standard sentences and texts.  
summary: This paper introduces an on-line rtMRI speech production data resource of a large subset of the sounds of the worldâ€™s languages as encoded in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), with supplementary English words and phonetically-balanced texts, produced by four prominent phoneticians. The technique images  the entirety of the vocal tract  in the production of each sound category. This resource is envisioned as a teaching tool in pronunciation training, second language acquisition, and speech therapy.
