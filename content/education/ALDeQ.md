shortdesc: The ALDeQ consists of questions for parents concerning the early and current development of an ESL child's first language. The purpose is to understand whether there may be evidence of delay or difficulties in the first language.  
summary: The ALDeQ would be useful to speech–language pathologists for obtaining information on English language learners’ first language development, in particular where the first language cannot be examined directly. The information provided by the ALDeQ could be used in conjunction with other measures in order to identify children with language impairment among English language learners.
