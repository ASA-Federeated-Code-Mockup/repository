shortdesc: The ALEQ consists of questions about family demographics, language use among family members in the home, and other aspects of an ESL child's language environment.  
summary: The purpose of the ALEQ is to provide background information on an ESL child that could be relevant for researchers as well as educators and clinicians. It should be given as an interview. The most important information from the ALEQ for the chesl website is the information on a child's length of exposure to English. This information is necessary for interpreting the analyses and norms from the language measures.
