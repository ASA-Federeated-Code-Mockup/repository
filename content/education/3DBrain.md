shortdesc: An interactive model of the brain to identify structures and functions. 
summary: The human brain is the most complex biological structure in the known universe. Its roughly 86 billion nerve cells power all of our thoughts, perceptions, memories, emotions, and actions. Itâ€™s what inspires us to build cities and compels us to gaze at the stars. This 3D model can be used by students, researchers, and educators to explore the make-up of the brain.
