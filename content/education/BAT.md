summary: The Bilingual Aphasia Test (BAT) was designed to assess each of the languages of a bilingual or multilingual individual with aphasia in an equivalent way. The various versions of the BAT are thus not mere translations of each other, but culturally and linguistically equivalent tests. The criteria of cross-language equivalence vary with each task. Each language test serves as a score sheet, so a new copy must be downloaded or photocopied for each patient, or for each assessment when replicated at different time intervals (e.g., pre- and post-therapy).
