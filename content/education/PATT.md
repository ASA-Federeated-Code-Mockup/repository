summary: The PATT is a useful protocol developed by Jessica Barlow, Jennifer Taps Richard and Holly Storkel for conducting a thorough assessment of a child’s speech in order to strategically select treatment targets based on the child’s presenting sound system, language laws, and treatment efficacy research. An automated version of the PATT, known as AutoPATT, has been developed by Philip Combiths and Ray Amberg. This is a plug-in for Phon, free phonological analysis software, available for Windows and MacOS, created by Yvan Rose and Greg Hedlund. Disclaimer: AutoPATT (and PATT) will select an ideal target that is predicted to lead to widespread gains in the child’s system, but it does not also include clinical judgment, for which there is no substitute. Consider these as tools for assisting — rather than dictating — target selection.
