shortdesc: The Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers, Revised with Follow-Up (M-CHAT-R/F) is a 2-stage parent-report screening tool to assess risk for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).  
summary: The M-CHAT-R/F is available for free download for clinical, research, and educational purposes. The M-CHAT-R can be administered and scored as part of a well-child care visit and also can be used by specialists or other professionals to assess risk for ASD. The primary goal of M-CHAT-R is to maximize sensitivity, meaning to detect as many cases of ASD as possible. Therefore, there is a high false positive rate, meaning that not all children who score at risk will be diagnosed with ASD. To address this, we have developed the Follow-Up questions (M-CHAT-R/F). Users should be aware that even with the Follow-Up a significant number of the children who screen positive on the M-CHAT-R will not be diagnosed with ASD; however these children are at high risk for other developmental disorders or delays, and therefore, evaluation is warranted for any child who screens positive. The M-CHAT-R can be scored in less than two minutes.
