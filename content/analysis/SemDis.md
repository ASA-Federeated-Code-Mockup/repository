shortdesc: SemDis uses advances in natural language processing to automatically determine how closely associated texts are to each other. Higher SemDis scores indicate two texts are less related, that is, they are more distantly related ideas or concepts.  
summary: SemDis uses advances in natural language processing to automatically determine how closely associated texts are to each other. Higher SemDis scores indicate two texts are less related, that is, they are more distantly related ideas or concepts. SemDis is a powerful tool for exploring text. It is an avenue to explore new ideas with automated feedback on originality. These 4 apps are for anyone who wants to explore how related texts are. We hope educators, learners, researchers and other professionals will find it useful.
