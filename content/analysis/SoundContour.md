shortdesc: A study of relative pitch - the relationships between the pitch of successive sounds - to determine whether properties of relative pitch would generalize to other auditory dimensions.  
summary: The pitch contour of a series of sounds is defined as the sequence of directions of pitch changes from note to note. It is the main determinant of melody recognition for novel random pitch sequences. We tested whether contours could be perceived in dimensions other than pitch.
