summary: FreeSurfer is an open source package for the analysis and visualization of structural, functional, and diffusion neuroimaging data from cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. It includes a full processing stream for MR imaging data that involves skull-stripping, bias field correction, registration, and anatomical segmentation as well as cortical surface reconstruction, registration, and parcellation. FreeSurfer also includes fMRI and diffusion tractography toolboxes, a robust visualization interface, utilities for statistical group analysis, and much more...
