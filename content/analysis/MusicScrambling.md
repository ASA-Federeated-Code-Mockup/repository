shortdesc: Example stimuli of music scrambled by pitch, rhythm, and both.  
summary: The idea is to create a new sound signal with roughly the same component elements, but with the musical structure destroyed. This is accomplished in two ways: by randomizing the pitch (adding a random amount to the pitch of each note, and then randomly reassigning pitches to notes), and by randomizing the onsets and durations (by adding a random amount to each note onset time, and then randomly reassigning note durations).
