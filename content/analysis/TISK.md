shortdesc: TISK is the Time Invariant String Model of (human) spoken word recognition.  
summary:  TISK is the Time Invariant String Model of (human) spoken word recognition. It is an interactive-activation model similar to the TRACE model (McClelland & Elman in Cognitive Psychology, 18, 1–86, 1986), but TISK replaces most of TRACE’s reduplicated, time-specific nodes with theoretically motivated time-invariant, open-diphone nodes.
