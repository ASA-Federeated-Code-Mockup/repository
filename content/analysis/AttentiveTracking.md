shortdesc: Humans track sound sources through feature space with a movable focus of attention. Attentive tracking aids segregation of similar sound sources.  
summary: Hearing a sound source of interest amid other sources (the ‘‘cocktail party problem’’) is difficult when sources are similar and change over time, as in speech. Woods and McDermott show that humans segregate sources in such situations using attentive tracking— employing a moving locus of attention to follow a sound as it changes over time.
