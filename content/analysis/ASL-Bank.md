shortdesc: An annotation tool for ASL videos with ELAN and ASL SLAASH conventions  
summary: a documentation tool that keeps track of visual ASL signs and their ID glosses (unique textual label for each sign) for the annotation of ASL videos of naturalistic ASL use by a wide range of users. The goal of the ASL Signbank is to be a collection of ID glosses, which are unique identifiers for signs regardless of how they are modified.
