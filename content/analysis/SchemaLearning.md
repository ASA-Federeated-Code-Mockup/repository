shortdesc: The cocktail party problem requires listeners to infer individual sound
sources from mixtures of sound. We explored whether listeners learn source “schemas”—the abstract structure shared by different occurrences of the same type of sound source—and use them to infer sources from mixtures.  
summary: The “cocktail party problem” is encountered when sounds from different sources in the world mix in the air before arriving at the ear, requiring the brain to estimate individual sources from the received mixture. Sounds produced by a given source often exhibit consistencies in structure that might be useful for separating sources if they could be learned. Here we show that listeners rapidly learn the abstract structure shared by sounds from novel sources and use the learned structure to extract these sounds when they appear in mixtures. The involvement of learning and memory in our ability to hear one sound among many opens an avenue to understanding the role of statistical regularities in auditory scene analysis.
