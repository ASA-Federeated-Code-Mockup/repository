shortdesc: Used to calculate the phonotactic probabilities of real English, Arabic, and Spanish words or specially constructed nonwords. Analyses can be performed on words or nonwords up to 17 phonemes in length.  
summary: Phonotactic probability refers to the frequency with which a phonological segment, such as /s/, and a sequence of phonological segments, such as /s^/, occur in a given position in a word. The biphone probability that is calculated in this program is based on the co-occurrence of segments within words and not on the transitional probabilities of sounds between words as they might occur in fluent speech.
