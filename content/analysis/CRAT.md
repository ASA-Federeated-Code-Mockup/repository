summary: CRAT is an easy to use tool that includes over 700 indices related to lexical sophistication, cohesion and source text/summary text overlap. CRAT is particularly well suited for the exploration of writing quality as it relates to summary writing. CRAT takes plain text files as input (it will process all plain text files in a particular folder) and produces a comma separated values (.csv) spreadsheet that is easily read by any spreadsheet software.
