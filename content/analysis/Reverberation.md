shortdesc: A large-scale statistical analysis of real-world acoustics, revealing strong regularities of reverberation in natural scenes.  
summary: In everyday listening, sound reaches our ears directly from a source as well as indirectly via reflections known as reverberation. Reverberation profoundly distorts the sound from a source, yet humans can both identify sound sources and distinguish environments from the resulting sound, via mechanisms that remain unclear. The core computational challenge is that the acoustic signatures of the source and environment are combined in a single signal received by the ear. We investigate the hypothesis that the human auditory system utilizes the natural statistics of environmental reverberation to separately infer sound and space from a reverberant signal.
