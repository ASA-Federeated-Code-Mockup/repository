summary: The Maryland Tongue Analysis Package (MTAP), containing EdgeTrak and Surfaces, was developed by the Vocal Tract Visualization Laboratory for use with ultrasound images of the tongue. Edge Trak tracks tongue and palate and extrasts them as a series of coordinate points which are saved in a text file. Surfaces displays a sequence of contours as a time-motion display. Contour sequences can be averaged and compared numerically.
