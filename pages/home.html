    <h3>Welcome to the Speech and Language Resource Bank!</h3>
<p>Here you can find links to a wide range of resources for research and teaching on speech and language. Our ultimate aim with this site is to provide a comprehensive index of the available resources in the field, complete with essential metadata and crosslinks between related work. </p>
<p>If you would like to contribute, particularly if you would like your own resource indexed on this site, please fill out the form, join the Slack channel (<a href="https://slrbank.slack.com">slrbank.slack.com</a>), or check out the Github organization (<a href="https://github.com/slrbnet">github.com/slrbnet</a>).</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>We're hiring</h3>
<p>We're hiring one hourly research assistant to help index resources for research and teaching in the speech sciences. Candidates from linguistics, psychology, speech &amp; hearing, communication sciences and disorders, and related disciplines are invited to apply. Unfortunately, we can only hire US citizens and residents at this time.</p>
<p>As an indexer for the SLRB your job will include the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Compiling a list of resources (e.g., databases, software, teaching tools, scripts / programming language libraries)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Writing metadata on those resources so that they can be indexed on our site</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Emailing resource authors to notify them of their inclusion in the site and to receive feedback on any necessary corrections to their entries</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This work will not only provide a vital service to the speech science community, but will also provide opportunities to network with researchers and educators in the field.</p>
<p>Compensation for this work will be 10 USD / hour for a maximum of 100 total hours. Your schedule and the number of hours you work per week is flexible.</p>
<p>Interested applicants should email a copy of their CV and a short description of their background to Charles Redmon (charles.redmon@ling-phil.ox.ac.uk), quoting "SLRB Indexer Application" in the subject line. Also feel free to email us if you have any general inquiries about the job.</p>
<p>This position will remain open until filled, but we are looking to fill them quickly so earlier applicants will be given priority.</p>

<h3>Browse</h3>
<p>The resources in the SLRB are broadly organized into four categories:</p>
<h4><a href="https://www.slrb.net/category/analysis.html">Analysis</a></h4>
<p>Anything related to the analysis of speech/language data, including software, packages/libraries for programming languages, and individual scripts will be indexed here.</p>
<h4><a href="https://www.slrb.net/category/data.html">Data</a></h4>
<p>All data resources, including audio, video, and text corpora, as well as experimental data such as participant responses in  behavioral perception tasks, will be indexed here.</p>
<h4><a href="https://www.slrb.net/category/education.html">Education</a></h4>
<p>Any educational material that would be useful for teaching speech/language science at any level will be indexed here. This includes images/diagrams, videos, and material (software or hardware) for classroom demonstrations.</p>
<h4><a href="https://www.slrb.net/category/experimentation.html">Experimentation</a></h4>
<p>Resources that may be used in designing or implementing experiments on speech and language, from software to run the experiment to code to generate experimental stimuli, will be indexed here. </p>
